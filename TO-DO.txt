- solve the grouping issue across scripts
- Update README with all new scripts
- Add in no-DBS condition to image of isi progression
- try making deltaH boxplot version with log transformed data! 

- update all IMPORTANT scripts to work with new tables and steps
	- stow away old scripts that won't be updated


- generalize string inputs in ppar so that assigning a cell array of strings gets them all chosen in the filter
- Update labelling of H_PREbootAv for both isi and psth tables
- make sure all currently used scripts can handle the ContactSweep case
- redo boxplot special function so that it accepts ppar structure for property control

DOWN THE LINE:
- describe in comments each script's output data as well, so that tests can be designed around them. 
- Implement Phase-lock detection in a common function rather than repeated in each script
- scatter and pie: factor in the one-category case
- Annotate all tables with descriptions, both general and for variables
- Add in an initialization step where the project folder and subfolders are added to the path, but not the git stuff in it
- tally up which fields each script needed from ppar and add comment reference in body of script
- update master table to count C3 as frequency sweep too & update master table filter with ppar for Contact to use for Fsweep choice
- Create a master ppar checker for allowed ppar inputs
- begin each script with a checking function for ppar fields to make sure they are inputs compatible with script
- Redo EntropyPsthLetter_Analysis_SU_2HzThresh_60pre_60dbs_10000boots table to reflect intermediatData vs. AnalysisData table rules
- Generate table/individual files for intermediate PSTH mat files
- Generate table/individual files for intermediate logISI mat files
- Create repeatable pipeline for different input parameters
- implement tracking of table-generating metadata within each table:
	- timeToGenerate
	- datetimeGenerated
	- generatingFunc
	- ParentTables
	- ChildTables
- Add full descriptions to all tables
- implement automated mass-update step of all data that depends on some parent data when that parent data is changed



RULES TO FOLLOW WHEN WRITING NEW CODE:
1. All whole-table operations are to happen at the "script_ ... " level; the only exceptions are the functions found in "scr\tableFuncs"
2. When possible, modular functions are to be made and shared across scripts, with inputs as general as possible (i.e. no table inputs or specificially named inputs). 
	2.1 For functions, special instructions to be passed in ppar struct if needed.
3. All intermediate processing steps should generate a .mat at the RECORD level
4. Every time a change is made to a piece of code, test-run all dependent operations for consistent behavior

Scripts: they perform either a VISUALIZATION, or a STAT TEST (or both). Need to specify all output data in comments.
Functions: they serve as INTERMEDIATE PROCESSING operations that can potentially be shared across scripts and/or other functions



DONE:
- implement entropyType selection in boxplots script
- decide on LFS and HFS grouping approach
- update script_displayPhaseLockPercVsdbsTrialCond_barplot.m to give a table with numerical results 
- Find out if new way to plot deltaH boxplots is WRONG??? (ASSUME THAT MY LATEST PIPELINE IS CORRECT, AND THE OLD STUFF IS WRONG)
- Extend script_CompareRatePsthIsi.m to disp objectID and filenum, as well as rate test
- create script for showing pie chart of number of phase-locked cells detected
- separate out AnalyzeEntropy script into simplest possible outputs
- update ppar list with ppar.dispPhaseLocked = 'phaseLck'; % 'phaseLck' | 'nonPhaseLck' | 'both'
- update phllock script with filterTable_Master function
- Redo spkRate intermediate Data to pool both subjects
- Release an alpha of Entropy toolbox
- Create preliminary parameter initialization script
- Combine 3 main tables into one super-table
- Redo EntropyISI table with intermediate data stored
- Redo EntropyLetter table with intermediate data stored
